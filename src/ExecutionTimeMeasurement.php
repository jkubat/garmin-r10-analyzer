 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Execution Time Measurement
 |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 |
 | Requires PHP 8
 |
 | This is a simple execution time measurement class for blocks of code and callables
 |
 | Usage:
 | $timer = new ExecutionTimeMeasurement("Some Timer Description", false);
 | $timer->start()
 |      [... block of code ...]
 | $result = $timer->getResult();
 |
 | The above can be simplified by passing true to the constructor as a second parameter:
 | $timer = new ExecutionTimeMeasurement("Some Timer Description, true);
 |      [... block of code ...]
 | $result = $timer->getResult();
 |
 | When testing Callables, it can be even more simplified to one line
 | note: second argument will be ignored
 | $timer = new ExecutionTimeMeasurement("Some Timer Description, false, function() { <function_call> })
